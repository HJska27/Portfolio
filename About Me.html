            I am a high school student that is on a journey to become a software engineer. I currently attend Roosevelt
            High School and am projected to graduate in 2025. I created a volleyball team and became the leader. During
            this time I led my team through multiple volleyball tournaments, even winning some. I also have work
            experience as a cashier and baker for a shop called Nummy Yummy. This shop was located inside Fashion Fair
            mall food court. I worked for around 2 months and during this time I learned vital skills such as work
            ethic, time management, and how to correctly communicate with customers. I have also done 2 hours of
            community service for my school which involved us cleaning trash around our community.
