            <p>
                Budget Calculator: EECU gave my class the task of creating a calculator that would be able to calculate
                the
                salaries of a occupation that was chosen and also provide how they would be able to budget their
                salaries.
                While
                working on this project I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete the task I was given. Using HTML I
                typed
                out all the content required for my website this includes the occupations, text bars, and the user
                interface.
                With CSS I decorated my website making it look way better then before. CSS allowed me to style my
                website in
                a
                way that made it look very professional. With HTML and CSS complete I moved onto JavaScript. JavaScript
                was
                probably the most important part of my website because it essentially made sure that my website was
                fuctional
                and could actaully be used as a real budget calculator. With the 3 important parts of my website
                complete I
                reviewed over all of my code making sure there weren't any bugs or mistakes and then I uploaded my
                github
                into
                netlify completing my project.

        <p>
            Certificate Generator: At CART my teacher gave me the task to create a generator that created certificates
            and
            we had to make sure that the certificates generated with all the required information imputed. This includes
            name and date. To begin this project I wireframed how the certificates were going to look like and what the
            award was.
            After completing my wireframe I moved onto HTML using HTML I layed out the content of my website. These
            included
            the certficates and title. This project didn't require much CSS if any at all so I didn't focus on it.
            JavaScript was the most important part of this website becuase I had to make sure the time on the
            certificates
            automatically updated the the current date. Also I needed to make it so that on the certificate it correctly
            displayed the name that was inputed.

    <section class="jurassic">
        <p>Jurassic Park Website: My project this time invloved a Jurassic Park themed website. I also had to work on
            this
            project with a partner. Me and my partner came up with the idea of making a Jurassic Park themed website
            that
            allowed the users to book a hotel room at a Jurassic Park resort. Before we began coding our website we
            first
            went on Figma and created wireframes of our website so we knew what we were going to create. After
            completing
            our wireframes we moved onto coding. Since there was 2 of us we split the coding between us. i worked on the
            HTML content and CSS stlying and my partner worked on JavaScript since he was better at it. Using HTMl and
            CSS I
            added a bunch of picutres of the hotels we provide. I also typed out a bunch of text for our policy and
            other
            stuff. After all of content was finished I moved onto CSS. With CSS I made the webite look very good and
            professional. My partner used JavaScript to make our website actually function. He also made it so you could
            actually book hotels and it would bring you to a checkout page.

        <p>
            CSS Zen Garden: During this project my teacher wanted to test our CSS knowledge. We were all given the same
            website and all we had to do was use CSS to make the page unqiue. The theme I wanted to go for this project
            was
            a sunny sky. I used CSS to move around the text and title to the side. Then I found a image of a clear and
            bright sky and made that the background of my page. After that I looked for a sun image that I could insert
            into
            my website. With all of that done I completed my CSS zen garden and submitted it.

    <section class="board">
        <p>
            Board Game: During this project me and my partner were tasked to either create and code a text adventure
            game or
            create a idea for a board game and code it. Me and my partner decieded to challenge ourselves and create a
            board
            game. Before we began coding we had to brainstorm a good board game idea. After that we went onto Figma and
            wireframed our website design. Then we finally moved onto coding and I used HTML to lay out all the content
            of
            our board game. My partner used CSS to make our board game come to life. Since I was the one who was more
            proffiecent with JavaScript I was the one who coded it. I used JavaScript to create the gameboard. i did
            this
            using a array and then stlying the array using CSS. After that I made it possible to place the game pieces
            onto
            the board. Then finally I made sure that JavaScript was able to check the array by going through the rows
            and
            columns to check for 5 in a row, verticaly, or diagonally. Then i made a landing page that explained how to
            play
            our game and then submitted the final product.
