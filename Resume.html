            I want to be a software engineer. I am currently learning how to code at CART. I currently know how to use 3
            coding
            languages they are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a very strong work ethic and will make sure to do tasks
            given
            to me with 100%.

            While I worked here, I gained a lot of experience with washing dishes and learned how to properly operate in
            a
            working environment.

            At CART I worked with other students to create a website dedicated to booking hotels for a fictional company
            at
            Jurassic Park. My role during this process was to use CSS to style the website and add content to text
            boxes.

            If you want to look at some of the projects I have worked on, my GitHub is HJska27. On my profile are some
            of the
            projects that I have worked on while at CART. I have also done 2 hours of volunteer work that involved
            cleaning and
            picking up trash around my community.
